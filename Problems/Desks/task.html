  <p>A university has&nbsp;decided to open math courses and&nbsp;equip classrooms for 3 groups with&nbsp;special new desks. The faculty agreed that in the sake of productivity only&nbsp;two students may share one table. The enrolment has ended, and now the task is to count the number of desks to order the correct amount from the shop.&nbsp;Of course, the university is short of&nbsp;money, so you need to calculate the minimum of desks. But don't forget that each group will sit in its own classroom!</p> 
  <p><strong>Input data format</strong></p> 
  <p>The program receives the input of the three non-negative integers: the number of students in each of the three groups&nbsp;(the numbers is not bigger than 1000).</p>
