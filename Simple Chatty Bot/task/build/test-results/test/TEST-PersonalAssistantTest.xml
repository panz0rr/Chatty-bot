What a great name you have, Marry!
Let me guess your age.
Say me remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.

Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.
